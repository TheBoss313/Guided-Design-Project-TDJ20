## Brainstorming/Research
### Basic Design Description
The design  is a simplified version of a frustum. However, it is simplified by only having one axis of lean instead of two.  
The cross-bracing structure originates from the cross-bracing of an oil rig.  
![Image of the cross bracing on an oil rig](https://ascelibrary.org/cms/asset/a1706726-1c11-496f-b6d8-1858d185681e/figure3.jpg)
The cross-bracing is simplified to only go up one diagonal instead of making an "X", to reduce weight.

## Planning
### Cutlist
GENERATE FROM 3D-Sketch
### Tools
* 3/4" x 3/4" x ??" Material Preparation
  * Table Saw
  * Planar
  * Compound Miter Saw (CMS)
* Specific piece preparation
  * Compound Miter Saw (CMS)
  * Band Saw
  * Hammer & Chisel
* Assembly & Finish
  * Nail Gun (Single Shot)
  * Glue (Sticky yellowish liquid)
  * Coarse Sawdust
  * Fine Sawdust (slightly off-white powder)
  * Belt Sander (BS)
  * Orbital Disk Sander (The ODS&trade; are in your favour)  
 ### PPE
 Safety Equipment:
 * Safety Glasses
 * *Sensum Communem*
   
 Safety Concerns:
 * Kickback on all saws + Planar
 * Sharp blades on all saws + chisel + Planar
 * Spinning Blades&trade; on CMS + Planar
 * Coarse Sanding Paper on BS
 * Propelled Pointy Pieces of Metal (Nails)
 * Suffocation (Sawdust)
 * Noise (Everything, children in particular)
