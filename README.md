## Brainstorming/Research
### Basic Design Description
The design  is a simplified version of a frustum. However, it is simplified by only having one axis of lean instead of two.  
The cross-bracing structure originates from the cross-bracing of an oil rig.

The cross-bracing is simplified to only go up one diagonal instead of making an "X", to reduce weight.
