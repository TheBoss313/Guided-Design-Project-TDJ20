## Brainstorming/Research
### Basic Design Description
The design  is a simplified version of a frustum. However, it is simplified by only having one axis of lean instead of two.  
The cross-bracing structure originates from the cross-bracing of an oil rig.  
![Image of the cross bracing on an oil rig](https://ascelibrary.org/cms/asset/a1706726-1c11-496f-b6d8-1858d185681e/figure3.jpg)
The cross-bracing is simplified to only go up one diagonal instead of making an "X", to reduce weight.

### Cutlist
| Piece ID | Qty. | Material | Size | Additional Notes |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| 0 | 4    | White pine 3/4" thickness | 3/4" x 3/4" x 6.5" | N/A |
| 2 | 2    | White pine 3/4" thickness | 3/4" x 3/4" x ~24.163" | Cut ends at 75&deg; |
| 3 | 4    | White pine 3/4" thickness | 3/4" x 3/4" x 25" | Start with 25" piece then cut ends at 5&deg;. Make cutouts at the top to fit top piece (ID 7.|
| 4 | 2    | White pine 3/4" thickness | 3/4" x 3/4" x 6.5" | Start with 6.5" piece then cut ends at 5&deg; |

 ## Fabrication
### Order of Operations
1. Take pieces 3, 7, 4 and put them together with glue and nails. 2 pieces (3) are connected by a 7, and a 4. The 7 goes into the cutout at the top of 3, 4 connects between the very bottoms of 3s. there should now be 2 trapezoids.
2. Take the trapezoids and 6 and put 6 as high up as it will go in the trapezoid, parallel to 7 and 4. Glue and nail.
3. Repeat step 2 with piece 5 instead of 4.
4. Piece 8 goes in between the top two horisontals in the trapezoid. Glue and nail.
5. Piece 9 goes in between the middle two horizontals. Glue and nail.
6. Connect the two trapezoids together to create a truncated pyramid. Connect at the corners with piece 0s. Glue and nail.
7. Put piece 2s in between piece 0s (paird by side of pyramid). Sand if neccesary. Glue and nail.
8. Sand & level tower by using small thin bits of wood.

### Evaluation
![Tower with 235lbs on it...](IMG_3024.jpg)
Tower Weight: 1.75lbs  
Mass weight tested: 235 lbs  
### Innovation
* Make better tower prosthetics
* Make angles easier to cut and draw
* 5&deg; angle unnecesary - could make the sides vertical
